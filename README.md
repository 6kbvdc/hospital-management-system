Hospital Management System in Python


Description


Python-based hospital management system with SQLite database support. Manages patients, staff, and appointments through a command-line interface. Designed to improve clinic efficiency and record-keeping, demonstrating practical software design, relational database usage, and problem-solving skills.


Problem Solved


Many clinics rely on paper records, which are slow, error-prone, and hard to track. This system digitizes record-keeping, allowing clinics to store, retrieve, and manage patient and staff information reliably.


Features


Add, view, update, and delete patients and staff
Schedule, view, and manage appointments
Input validation for dates, times, and fields
Persistent storage using SQLite database
Menu-driven interface for easy navigation


Tools Used

Python 3
SQLite database
Standard Python libraries


How to Run

Open hospital_system.py in a Python 3 environment.
The command-line menu displays numbered options for all operations.
Enter the number of the desired action and follow the prompts.
Type 12 in the main menu to exit the system.
System Design
Three relational tables: patients, staff, appointments
Data persists automatically between program runs
Functions are modular for maintainability and clarity
Menu interface guides the user through all operations


Skills Demonstrated

Relational database design with SQLite
CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
Input validation and error handling
Modular program structure
Practical application of Python for real-world problem solving


Future Improvements

Add graphical user interface
User login and role-based permissions
Reporting and statistics dashboard
Online or remote access for telemedicine
