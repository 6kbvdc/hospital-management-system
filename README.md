Hospital Management System in Python

Description:
This project is a command line hospital management system built with Python and SQLite. It stores patients, staff, and appointments in a database and helps a small clinic manage records digitally.


Problem:
Paper records waste time and lead to errors. Staff struggle to find files and track appointments. I built this system to store data safely and retrieve it fast.


Features:
• Add, view, update, and delete patients
• Add, view, update, and delete staff
• Schedule and cancel appointments
• Validate date and time inputs
• Save all records using SQLite
• Menu based interface for simple use

Tools:
• Python 3
• SQLite
• Standard libraries


How to run:
• Install Python 3
• Open terminal in the project folder
• Run python hospital_system.py
• Follow the menu options


System design:
• Three tables, patients, staff, appointments
• Foreign keys link appointments to patients and staff
• Data saves between runs
• Functions split by feature for clean structure


What I learned:
• Database design
• CRUD operations
• Input validation
• Structuring larger programs
• Building software for real world problems
